# Feature Specification: Audio Playback Controls

**Feature Branch**: `004-audio-playback-controls`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add audio playback controls to the Chrome extension. Users should be able to pause, resume, and stop the text-to-speech audio playback. The controls should appear as a floating panel when audio starts playing and disappear when audio stops or is manually stopped. The panel should have clear pause/play toggle button and a stop button. It should be visually consistent with the existing toast notifications and not obstruct reading content."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Pause Playing Audio (Priority: P1)

A user is listening to text-to-speech audio on a webpage and needs to pause it temporarily (e.g., to take a phone call, re-read a section, or focus on something else). They want a quick, obvious way to pause without stopping the audio completely.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental control users expect when consuming audio content. Without pause functionality, users must either listen through the entire audio or stop it completely, losing their place. This is the core value of playback controls.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting TTS audio playback, clicking the pause button, and verifying audio stops playing while maintaining playback position. Delivers immediate value by giving users basic playback control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is currently playing, **When** user clicks the pause button on the floating control panel, **Then** audio playback pauses immediately and the pause button changes to a play button
2. **Given** audio is currently playing, **When** user clicks the pause button, **Then** the current playback position is preserved (audio doesn't restart from beginning)
3. **Given** audio is playing and controls are visible, **When** user clicks pause, **Then** the control panel remains visible with the play button active

### User Story 2 - Resume Paused Audio (Priority: P1)

A user has paused audio playback and wants to continue listening from where they left off. They expect a clear visual indication that audio is paused and an obvious way to resume.

**Why this priority**: Resume is the natural complement to pause and equally critical for basic playback control. Without resume, pause functionality is incomplete. These two form the minimum viable playback control.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by pausing audio, then clicking the play button to resume. Delivers value by completing the pause/resume cycle, allowing users to control their listening experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is paused, **When** user clicks the play button on the control panel, **Then** audio resumes playing from the exact position where it was paused
2. **Given** audio is paused, **When** user clicks play, **Then** the play button changes back to a pause button
3. **Given** audio is paused and user navigates away from the page, **When** user returns and clicks play, **Then** audio resumes from the saved position (if technically feasible within session)

---

### User Story 3 - Stop Audio Playback (Priority: P2)

A user wants to completely stop audio playback and close the controls because they're done listening or want to start over with different text. They need a way to end the audio session entirely.

**Why this priority**: While pause/resume handles temporary interruptions, stop is needed for ending the listening session. It's secondary to pause/resume because users can achieve similar results by pausing and ignoring the audio, but stop provides cleaner UX and resource management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing audio, clicking stop, and verifying both audio playback ends and controls disappear. Delivers value by giving users a clear way to end their listening session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is playing or paused, **When** user clicks the stop button, **Then** audio playback stops completely and cannot be resumed
2. **Given** audio is playing or paused, **When** user clicks stop, **Then** the control panel disappears from the page
3. **Given** audio has been stopped, **When** user triggers new audio playback, **Then** new audio starts from the beginning with fresh controls

---

### User Story 4 - Automatic Control Display (Priority: P2)

When a user triggers text-to-speech playback, they need to see playback controls automatically appear without any additional action. The controls should be immediately visible and accessible.

**Why this priority**: Auto-showing controls is important for discoverability and usability, but the controls themselves (P1) must exist first. This is a UX enhancement that makes the feature more intuitive.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering TTS playback and verifying controls appear automatically in a visible, non-obstructive location. Delivers value by eliminating the need for users to search for controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects text and triggers TTS playback, **When** audio begins playing, **Then** the control panel appears automatically on the page
2. **Given** no audio is currently playing, **When** new audio playback starts, **Then** controls appear within 500ms of audio start
3. **Given** controls are showing for previous audio, **When** new audio starts, **Then** controls update to control the new audio session

---

### User Story 5 - Automatic Control Hiding (Priority: P3)

When audio playback ends naturally or is stopped, the control panel should disappear automatically to avoid cluttering the page. Users shouldn't need to manually close controls.

**Why this priority**: Auto-hiding is a nice-to-have polish feature. Manual hiding (stop button) can serve this purpose, making auto-hide less critical. However, it improves UX by cleaning up the interface automatically.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by letting audio play to completion or clicking stop, and verifying controls disappear. Delivers value by maintaining clean page layout without user intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is playing to the end, **When** audio playback completes naturally, **Then** control panel disappears within 2 seconds (may include optional fade-out animation if implemented)
2. **Given** audio is stopped via stop button, **When** stop button is clicked, **Then** control panel disappears immediately
3. **Given** user navigates to a new page while audio plays, **When** page changes, **Then** controls disappear (audio may stop or continue based on extension design)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when audio ends naturally while controls are visible? → Controls should disappear automatically within 2 seconds (with optional fade-out animation if implemented)
- What happens when user navigates to a new page while audio is playing? → Controls should disappear; audio behavior depends on extension architecture (stop or continue in background)
- What happens when multiple audio sessions are triggered in quick succession? → New controls replace old controls; only one control panel should be visible at a time
- How do controls behave on different viewport sizes (mobile vs desktop)? → Controls should scale appropriately and remain visible/accessible on all screen sizes
- What happens if user triggers TTS while audio is already playing? → Current audio stops, new audio starts, controls update to control new session
- What if the floating panel overlaps with important page content? → Controls are positioned in a corner that minimally interferes with content (bottom-right for desktop, bottom-center for mobile) with high z-index to ensure visibility. Draggable controls are out of scope for this version.
- How do controls work on pages with complex layouts (sticky headers, fixed sidebars)? → Controls should have high z-index and position that avoids conflicts with common page elements

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a pause button that pauses audio playback and preserves current playback position
- **FR-002**: System MUST change pause button to a play button when audio is paused
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a play button that resumes audio from paused position
- **FR-004**: System MUST change play button to a pause button when audio is playing
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a stop button that completely ends audio playback
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a floating control panel when audio playback starts
- **FR-007**: System MUST hide the control panel when audio is stopped via stop button
- **FR-008**: System MUST hide the control panel when audio playback completes naturally
- **FR-009**: Control panel MUST use visual styling consistent with existing toast notifications (colors, fonts, borders, shadows)
- **FR-010**: Control panel MUST be positioned to minimize obstruction of page content (e.g., bottom-right or bottom-center of viewport)
- **FR-011**: Control panel MUST remain visible and accessible while audio is playing or paused
- **FR-012**: Only one control panel MUST be visible at a time (if new audio starts, replace existing controls)
- **FR-013**: Control buttons MUST provide clear visual feedback when clicked (hover states, active states)
- **FR-014**: Control panel MUST be responsive and functional on different viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### Key Entities

- **Control Panel**: Floating UI element that contains playback control buttons; appears/disappears based on audio state; styled consistently with toast notifications
- **Playback State**: Current state of audio (playing, paused, stopped); determines which buttons are shown/enabled in control panel
- **Audio Session**: A single instance of TTS audio playback; has associated playback state and control panel; one active session at a time

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can pause playing audio in under 2 seconds from the moment they decide to pause (button must be immediately visible and clickable)
- **SC-002**: Users can resume paused audio in under 2 seconds (play button clearly indicates resumption is available)
- **SC-003**: Users can stop audio completely in under 2 seconds (stop button is clearly differentiated from pause/play)
- **SC-004**: 95% of users successfully use controls without confusion (measured through usability testing or low error rates)
- **SC-005**: Control panel does not obstruct important page content in 99% of common page layouts (validated through testing on various websites)
- **SC-006**: Control panel appears within 500ms of audio playback starting (perceived as instantaneous by users)
- **SC-007**: Control panel disappears within 2 seconds of audio ending naturally (doesn't linger and clutter interface)
- **SC-008**: Users report controls are easy to find and use in feedback (qualitative measure of UX success)

## Assumptions

- Audio playback state is tracked by the existing audio player system (AudioPlayer class in offscreen document)
- Content script has the capability to inject and manage floating UI elements on web pages
- Existing toast notification CSS can be reused or adapted for control panel styling
- Chrome extension permissions allow content script to modify page DOM and respond to user interactions
- Only one audio session plays at a time (if new audio starts, previous audio is stopped/replaced)
- Controls don't need to be persistent across browser sessions (session-based playback)
- Standard browser audio controls are not sufficient (custom controls needed for UX consistency)

## Dependencies

- Existing audio playback system (AudioPlayer, offscreen document) must support pause/resume functionality
- Content script must have communication channel with background script to send pause/resume/stop commands
- Toast notification CSS/styling must be available for reuse in control panel design
- Background script must track current audio playback state and relay to content script

## Out of Scope

- Keyboard shortcuts for playback controls (may be added in future iteration)
- Scrubbing/seeking within audio (jumping to specific time positions)
- Volume controls
- Playback speed controls
- Audio progress indicator or timeline
- Playlist or queue management
- Downloading audio files
- Sharing audio with others
- Customizing control panel appearance beyond consistency with toast notifications
- Draggable/repositionable control panel (fixed position assumed)
