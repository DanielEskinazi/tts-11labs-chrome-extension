# Feature Specification: Playback Speed Control

**Feature Branch**: `005-playback-speed-control`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Playback Speed Control - Allow users to adjust the playback speed of text-to-speech audio (0.5x to 2x) with a simple control in the audio control panel. Users should be able to change speed during playback, and their preferred speed should be remembered for future audio sessions."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Adjust Speed During Active Playback (Priority: P1)

As a user listening to text-to-speech audio, I want to adjust the playback speed while the audio is playing so that I can speed up or slow down content without interrupting my listening experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - users need the ability to change speed dynamically. Without this, the feature has no value. Delivers immediate user value independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting audio playback, clicking the speed control (button or slider), and verifying that speed changes immediately without stopping the audio. Delivers complete speed adjustment functionality on its own.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is playing at normal speed (1x), **When** user selects 1.5x speed, **Then** audio continues playing at 1.5x speed without pausing or restarting
2. **Given** audio is playing at 1.5x speed, **When** user selects 0.75x speed, **Then** audio slows down smoothly to 0.75x without interruption
3. **Given** audio is playing, **When** user changes speed multiple times rapidly, **Then** each speed change applies immediately and audio remains smooth
4. **Given** audio is paused, **When** user changes speed, **Then** new speed is applied when playback resumes

### User Story 2 - Quick Access to Common Speed Presets (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want quick access to common playback speeds (0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x) so that I can easily switch between my preferred speeds without fiddling with precise controls.

**Why this priority**: Makes the feature highly usable. Without preset options, users would need a slider or input field which is slower and less intuitive. This is part of the MVP as it defines the primary interaction method.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by displaying speed preset buttons/dropdown, clicking each preset, and verifying the speed changes correctly. Works independently without persistence or visual indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is playing, **When** user clicks "1.5x" preset button, **Then** audio immediately plays at 1.5x speed
2. **Given** audio is playing at 2x speed, **When** user clicks "1x" preset button, **Then** audio returns to normal speed
3. **Given** user opens speed control, **When** user views available options, **Then** all seven common speeds (0.5x - 2x) are clearly displayed
4. **Given** audio is at 0.5x speed, **When** user clicks "2x" preset, **Then** audio plays at maximum speed (largest speed change)

### User Story 3 - Persistent Speed Preference (Priority: P2)

As a frequent user, I want my preferred playback speed to be remembered across sessions so that I don't have to adjust the speed every time I listen to new content.

**Why this priority**: Quality-of-life improvement that enhances user experience but isn't required for basic functionality. Users can still use speed control effectively without persistence - they just need to set it each time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting a speed, closing the browser, reopening, and starting new audio. Verifies the speed preference is saved and auto-applied. Can be implemented and tested separately from other stories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user sets speed to 1.5x and finishes listening, **When** user starts new audio in a new browser session, **Then** audio automatically plays at 1.5x speed
2. **Given** user has never changed speed, **When** user starts audio for the first time, **Then** audio plays at default 1x speed
3. **Given** user's saved preference is 1.25x, **When** user manually changes to 2x, **Then** 2x becomes the new saved preference for future sessions
4. **Given** user has saved preference of 1.5x, **When** user changes to 1x then back to 1.5x, **Then** 1.5x remains the saved preference

### User Story 4 - Clear Speed Indicator (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to see the current playback speed clearly displayed so that I always know how fast the audio is playing without guessing.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have enhancement that improves user awareness. Users can determine speed by listening, so this is more about polish than functionality. Can be added after core features work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by changing speeds and verifying the displayed speed value updates correctly. Visual-only feature that can be implemented independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio is playing at 1.5x speed, **When** user views the control panel, **Then** "1.5x" is clearly displayed as the current speed
2. **Given** user changes speed from 1x to 2x, **When** speed change completes, **Then** displayed speed updates to "2x" immediately
3. **Given** speed is at default 1x, **When** user views control panel, **Then** speed indicator shows "1x" (or "Normal")
4. **Given** audio is paused, **When** user views control panel, **Then** speed indicator still shows the current speed setting

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user changes speed while audio is buffering or loading?
  - Speed setting should be queued and applied once audio starts playing
- How does the system handle rapid speed changes (user clicking multiple presets quickly)?
  - Each change should apply immediately, overriding the previous setting
- What happens if saved speed preference is corrupted or invalid (e.g., value outside 0.5x-2x range)?
  - System should fallback to default 1x speed and log a warning
- How does very slow speed (0.5x) affect audio quality?
  - Audio should remain clear at all supported speeds (browser handles this natively)
- What happens when user refreshes page during playback?
  - New playback session should start at user's saved preference speed
- How does speed control interact with pause/resume functionality?
  - Speed setting should persist across pause/resume cycles without resetting

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support playback speeds ranging from 0.5x (half speed) to 2x (double speed) in 0.25x increments
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to change playback speed while audio is actively playing
- **FR-003**: Speed changes MUST apply immediately without stopping or restarting the audio
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide at least seven speed presets: 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist the user's selected speed preference across browser sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically apply the saved speed preference when new audio starts
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the current playback speed to the user
- **FR-008**: System MUST default to 1x speed for first-time users (no saved preference)
- **FR-009**: Speed control MUST be accessible from the existing audio control panel
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate speed values and reject invalid inputs (outside 0.5x-2x range)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain smooth audio playback during speed transitions (no pops, clicks, or gaps)
- **FR-012**: System MUST update the saved preference whenever the user changes speed

### Key Entities

- **Speed Preference**: Represents the user's saved playback speed setting
  - Range: 0.5x to 2x (decimal value)
  - Persistence: Stored across browser sessions
  - Default: 1.0x (normal speed)
  - Scope: Per-user (not per-audio-file)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can change playback speed in under 2 seconds from control panel
- **SC-002**: Speed changes apply within 100 milliseconds (perceived as instant)
- **SC-003**: 95% of speed changes complete without audio interruption or quality degradation
- **SC-004**: Speed preference persists correctly across 100% of browser sessions
- **SC-005**: 90% of users successfully find and use the speed control on first attempt (usability test)
- **SC-006**: Audio quality remains acceptable at all supported speeds (0.5x - 2x) as verified by user testing
- **SC-007**: Speed control integrates seamlessly with existing pause/resume/stop controls

## Out of Scope *(optional - include if helpful)*

- Custom speed input (e.g., typing "1.37x") - only presets are supported
- Per-audio-file speed preferences (speed is global, not per-content)
- Speed ramping or gradual speed changes (speed changes are instant)
- Visual pitch correction or audio enhancement at extreme speeds
- Keyboard shortcuts for speed control (can be added in future)
- Speed control for non-TTS audio or video content

## Dependencies & Assumptions *(optional - include if relevant)*

### Dependencies

- Existing audio control panel (implemented in feature 004-audio-playback-controls)
- Browser support for HTMLAudioElement.playbackRate API (standard in all modern browsers)
- Existing storage mechanism for user preferences (chrome.storage.local)

### Assumptions

- Users will primarily use preset speeds rather than needing precise custom values
- Browser's native playbackRate API provides acceptable audio quality at all supported speeds
- Most users will prefer speeds between 1x and 1.5x (based on typical TTS usage patterns)
- Control panel has sufficient space for speed control UI (button group or compact dropdown)
- Speed changes do not require re-fetching audio from the API (handled by browser)
