# Specification Quality Checklist: Audio Playback Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items complete

### Detailed Review:

**Content Quality** - All items pass:
- ✅ No implementation details mentioned (no languages, frameworks, or specific APIs)
- ✅ Focused entirely on user value (pause/resume/stop controls for better UX)
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders (plain language, no technical jargon)
- ✅ All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

**Requirement Completeness** - All items pass:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the spec (all decisions made with reasonable defaults)
- ✅ Requirements are testable (e.g., "pause button pauses audio" can be directly verified)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "Users can pause in under 2 seconds", "95% success rate")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not implementation)
- ✅ All user stories have acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- ✅ Edge cases identified and documented (navigation, multiple sessions, viewport sizes)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded in "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed

**Feature Readiness** - All items pass:
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-014) maps to user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover all primary flows (pause, resume, stop, show/hide controls)
- ✅ Success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- ✅ No implementation leakage (AudioPlayer mentioned only in Assumptions, not Requirements)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

The spec successfully:
- Prioritizes user stories (P1: pause/resume, P2: stop/auto-show, P3: auto-hide)
- Defines independently testable stories per SpecKit template requirements
- Provides measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Documents reasonable assumptions and dependencies
- Identifies relevant edge cases
- Sets clear scope boundaries

No issues found. Recommended next step: `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
