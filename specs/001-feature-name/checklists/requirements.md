# Specification Quality Checklist: Basic Extension Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: The specification avoids implementation details and focuses on user needs and business value. It uses language accessible to non-technical stakeholders while being precise about requirements.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain as all requirements have reasonable defaults or clear specifications based on Chrome extension standards.

**Success Criteria**: All 8 success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic, and user-focused. They focus on outcomes (time, percentages, user actions) rather than implementation details.

**Feature Readiness**: The spec defines 3 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios. Edge cases are well-documented. Scope boundaries clearly delineate what's in and out of scope for this phase.

## Notes

- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All mandatory sections complete with concrete details
- No outstanding clarifications needed
- Assumptions documented for API key format validation approach
