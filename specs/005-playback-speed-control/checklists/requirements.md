# Specification Quality Checklist: Playback Speed Control

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Quality Summary**:
- ✅ 4 user stories with clear prioritization (P1, P1, P2, P3)
- ✅ Each story is independently testable with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012), all testable
- ✅ 7 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007), all technology-agnostic
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- ✅ Out of scope items explicitly listed to prevent scope creep
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are unambiguous

**Spec highlights**:
- Speed range: 0.5x - 2x with 7 presets
- Browser-native playbackRate API (dependency)
- Persistence via chrome.storage.local (dependency)
- Integration with existing control panel (feature 004)
