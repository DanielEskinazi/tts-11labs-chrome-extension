# Tasks: Audio Playback Controls

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-audio-playback-controls/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì, data-model.md ‚úì, contracts/messages.md ‚úì

**Tests**: No automated tests requested - manual testing per quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare development environment and validate existing extension structure

**No new project setup needed** - this feature integrates into existing Chrome extension

- [ ] T001 Verify extension is installed and working (chrome://extensions/)
- [ ] T002 Review existing toast notification Shadow DOM pattern in content.js (lines 135-221)
- [ ] T003 [P] Review existing AudioPlayer API in src/api/audio.js (pause, resume, stop methods)
- [ ] T004 [P] Review existing message passing patterns in background.js (lines 98-166)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core control panel infrastructure and state management that all user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Create control panel Shadow DOM structure in content.js following toast pattern
- [ ] T006 Implement showControlPanel() function with Shadow DOM creation and error handling in content.js

- [ ] T010 [P] Add isActionPending debounce flag management in content.js
- [ ] T011 Add AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED handler in offscreen.js (wire to audioPlayer.onStatusChange callback)
- [ ] T012 Add AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED router in background.js (translate to content script messages)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - control panel can be created/destroyed, state sync infrastructure exists

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Pause Playing Audio (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: User can pause text-to-speech audio playback while preserving position

**Independent Test**: Start TTS audio, click pause button, verify audio stops and button changes to play icon while maintaining playback position

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [US1] Add pause button to control panel Shadow DOM template in content.js
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement handleControlPauseClicked() function in content.js (optimistic UI update)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Resume Paused Audio (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: User can resume paused audio from the exact position where it was paused

**Independent Test**: Pause audio, then click play button and verify audio resumes from saved position (not from beginning)

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T026 [US2] Test button icon toggles correctly (‚è∏ ‚Üî ‚ñ∂)
- [ ] T027 [US2] Update ARIA labels for play button accessibility in content.js

**Checkpoint**: User can pause and resume audio. Playback position is maintained across pause/resume cycles.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Stop Audio Playback (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can completely stop audio playback and close controls when done listening

**Independent Test**: Play audio, click stop button, verify audio stops completely and control panel disappears

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T032 [US3] Test stop removes control panel completely
- [ ] T033 [US3] Test new audio playback starts fresh after stop
- [ ] T034 [US3] Add ARIA label for stop button accessibility in content.js

**Checkpoint**: User can stop audio and controls disappear. New audio starts from beginning (position reset verified).

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Automatic Control Display (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Control panel appears automatically when audio playback starts without user action

**Independent Test**: Trigger TTS playback and verify controls appear within 500ms in a visible, non-obstructive location

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T035 [US4] Add AUDIO_PLAYBACK_STARTED message sender in background.js (after successful PLAY_AUDIO)

- [ ] T039 [US4] Test only one control panel exists at a time (new audio replaces old controls)
- [ ] T040 [US4] Add timing log to verify panel appears within 500ms

**Checkpoint**: Controls appear automatically when audio starts. Only one control panel visible at any time.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Automatic Control Hiding (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Control panel disappears automatically when audio playback ends naturally or is stopped

**Independent Test**: Let audio play to completion or click stop, verify controls disappear automatically

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T041 [US5] Add AUDIO_PLAYBACK_STOPPED message sender in background.js (on natural audio end)
- [ ] T042 [US5] Wire audioPlayer.onPlaybackEnd callback in offscreen.js to send AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED with status='idle'
- [ ] T043 [US5] Handle 'idle' status in background.js AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED handler (send AUDIO_PLAYBACK_STOPPED with reason='ended')
- [ ] T044 [US5] Test control panel auto-hides when audio ends naturally
- [ ] T045 [US5] Test control panel auto-hides immediately when stop button clicked
- [ ] T046 [US5] Add fade-out animation before removal (optional enhancement)

**Checkpoint**: Controls disappear automatically on audio end (natural or user-stopped). Page layout stays clean.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
  - US1 and US2 form the MVP (pause/resume controls)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after US1 - Shares button toggle logic with pause, tests depend on pause working
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent stop button, no dependencies on US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after US1, US2, US3 - Triggers control panel creation for all buttons
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after US4 - Requires auto-show to be working for auto-hide to make sense

### Within Each User Story

- Control panel foundation (T005-T012) MUST be complete first
- Message handlers before button implementations
- Content script handlers before background routers
- Optimistic UI updates before confirmation handlers
- Core implementation before testing tasks

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: T003 and T004 (review tasks) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T009 and T010 (content script utilities) can run in parallel with T011 and T012 (offscreen/background handlers)
- **Within User Stories**: Most tasks are sequential (button ‚Üí handler ‚Üí router ‚Üí confirmation)
- **Phase 8 Polish**: T047, T048, T051, T052 can all run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch content script utilities in parallel:
Task: "Add message validation utility for control messages in content.js"
Task: "Add isActionPending debounce flag management in content.js"

# While simultaneously working on offscreen/background infrastructure:
Task: "Add AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED handler in offscreen.js"
Task: "Add AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED router in background.js"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent concerns, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- No new files created - all changes integrate into existing content.js, background.js, offscreen.js
- Control panel created dynamically via Shadow DOM (no separate HTML/CSS files)
- Manual testing per quickstart.md (no automated test suite requested)
- Follow existing toast notification patterns for consistency
- Reuse existing AudioPlayer methods (pause, resume, stop) - no changes to audio.js needed
- Message passing follows established chrome.runtime patterns
- Each user story should be independently testable per quickstart.md checklists
- Verify controls work across different websites (Wikipedia, news sites, etc.)
- Test responsive positioning on mobile and desktop viewports
- Validate accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
