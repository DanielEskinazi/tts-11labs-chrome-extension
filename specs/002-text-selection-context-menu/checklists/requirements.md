# Specification Quality Checklist: Text Selection and Context Menu Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: The specification is written in clear, business-focused language. All technical implementation details (service workers, content scripts, Chrome APIs) are deferred to the planning phase. The spec focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, not HOW to implement it.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement is specific enough to be validated (e.g., "toast notification MUST appear for 3 seconds" can be measured). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain; all decisions have been made with reasonable defaults based on Chrome extension best practices.

**Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. They focus on user outcomes (e.g., "select text and see context menu within 100ms") rather than implementation details. Each can be verified through testing without knowing the underlying code.

**Feature Readiness**: The spec defines 3 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios for each. Edge cases are thoroughly documented (10 scenarios covered). Scope boundaries clearly delineate Phase 2 from Phases 3 and 4. All dependencies and assumptions are explicitly stated.

## Notes

- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All mandatory sections complete with concrete details
- No outstanding clarifications needed
- 10 assumptions documented with clear rationale
- 5 risks identified with mitigation strategies
