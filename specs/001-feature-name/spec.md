# Feature Specification: Basic Extension Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-name`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Chrome extension basic setup with manifest, popup UI, API key storage, and icons for ElevenLabs TTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Install and Configure Extension (Priority: P1)

A user downloads and installs the ElevenLabs TTS Chrome extension, then configures it with their API key to enable text-to-speech functionality.

**Why this priority**: Without installation and configuration, no other features can work. This is the absolute minimum viable product that allows users to start using the extension.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the extension, opening the popup, entering a valid API key, and verifying it's securely stored. Delivers immediate value by enabling the extension for use.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the extension is not installed, **When** user installs the extension from unpacked source, **Then** the extension icon appears in the Chrome toolbar
2. **Given** the extension is installed, **When** user clicks the extension icon, **Then** a popup window opens with an API key input field
3. **Given** the popup is open, **When** user enters a valid ElevenLabs API key and clicks save, **Then** the API key is securely stored in Chrome storage
4. **Given** an API key is saved, **When** user reopens the popup, **Then** the saved API key is displayed (masked for security)
5. **Given** the popup is open, **When** user enters an invalid API key format, **Then** an appropriate error message is displayed

### User Story 2 - View Extension Status (Priority: P2)

A user can quickly check whether the extension is properly configured and ready to use by viewing the popup interface.

**Why this priority**: Users need confidence that their setup is correct before attempting to use the extension. This provides immediate feedback on readiness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the popup and verifying that status indicators show whether an API key is configured. Delivers value through user confidence and troubleshooting capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no API key is stored, **When** user opens the popup, **Then** a message indicates "API key required" and prompts configuration
2. **Given** an API key is stored, **When** user opens the popup, **Then** a status indicator shows "Configured and ready"
3. **Given** the popup is open, **When** user wants to update their API key, **Then** they can clear the existing key and enter a new one

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Brand Recognition (Priority: P3)

A user can easily identify the ElevenLabs TTS extension among other installed extensions through distinctive iconography.

**Why this priority**: While important for user experience and brand recognition, the extension functions without custom icons. This enhances discoverability but isn't critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that extension icons appear correctly in the toolbar at multiple sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128). Delivers value through improved user experience and professional appearance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the extension is installed, **When** viewing the Chrome toolbar, **Then** the extension icon is clearly visible and recognizable
2. **Given** the user opens chrome://extensions, **When** viewing the extensions list, **Then** the extension displays proper 48x48 and 128x128 icons
3. **Given** the extension popup is open, **When** viewing the header, **Then** branding/icon is consistent with toolbar icon

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters an API key with leading/trailing whitespace?
- What happens when a user tries to save an empty API key?
- How does the system handle API key storage when Chrome storage is full or unavailable?
- What happens when the popup is opened while offline?
- What happens when a user uninstalls and reinstalls the extension (is the API key persisted)?
- How does the extension behave when Chrome storage permissions are denied?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Extension MUST comply with Chrome Manifest V3 specifications
- **FR-002**: Extension MUST provide a popup interface accessible via toolbar icon click
- **FR-003**: Extension MUST provide an input field for ElevenLabs API key entry
- **FR-004**: Extension MUST validate API key format before accepting (basic format validation, not API verification)
- **FR-005**: Extension MUST store API keys securely using chrome.storage.local API
- **FR-006**: Extension MUST persist API keys across browser sessions
- **FR-007**: Extension MUST allow users to view their stored API key (masked for security)
- **FR-008**: Extension MUST allow users to update or delete their stored API key
- **FR-009**: Extension MUST provide clear status indicators showing configuration state
- **FR-010**: Extension MUST display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-011**: Extension MUST include icons at required sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels)
- **FR-012**: Extension MUST declare minimum required permissions in manifest (storage, no excessive permissions)
- **FR-013**: Extension MUST load and display popup within 1 second of icon click
- **FR-014**: Extension MUST handle Chrome storage errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-015**: Extension MUST sanitize user input to prevent XSS or injection attacks

### Key Entities

- **API Key Configuration**: Stores the user's ElevenLabs API key, includes creation timestamp, last updated timestamp, and masked display value for UI
- **Extension Manifest**: Defines extension metadata including name, version, permissions, icons, and popup configuration
- **Popup UI State**: Tracks whether API key is configured, validation errors, and user interaction state

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can install the extension and configure their API key within 2 minutes
- **SC-002**: Extension popup loads and displays within 1 second of icon click on standard hardware
- **SC-003**: API keys persist correctly across 100% of browser restarts and extension reloads
- **SC-004**: Extension passes Chrome Web Store compliance review with no security or permission violations
- **SC-005**: 95% of users successfully save their API key on first attempt without errors
- **SC-006**: Zero storage-related errors occur under normal Chrome storage conditions
- **SC-007**: Extension icon is clearly visible and recognizable to users without confusion
- **SC-008**: All input validation provides immediate feedback within 500ms of user action
