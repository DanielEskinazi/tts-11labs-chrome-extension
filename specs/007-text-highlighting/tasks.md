# Tasks: Real-time Text Highlighting

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-text-highlighting/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Manual testing only (no automated test tasks - tests not requested in specification)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Chrome extension with flat structure
- Root files: manifest.json, content.js, background.js, offscreen.js, popup.*
- Utilities: src/utils/, src/api/
- Specs: specs/007-text-highlighting/

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: No additional setup needed - extension already initialized with all required permissions

**Note**: The extension already has content script access and message passing infrastructure. No manifest.json changes or new permissions needed.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core text parsing and timing utilities that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T001 [P] Create splitIntoSentences() function in src/utils/textUtils.js using regex /[.!?]+\s+/g
- [ ] T002 [P] Create calculateSentenceTimings() function in src/utils/textUtils.js for proportional timing
- [ ] T003 [P] Add CSS highlight styles injection function in content.js (.tts-highlight class)
- [ ] T004 Add HighlightState initialization in content.js with all entity fields from data-model.md

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Sentence Highlighting During Playback (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Highlight each sentence sequentially as audio plays, with smooth transitions between sentences

**Independent Test**: Select text ‚Üí trigger playback ‚Üí verify each sentence highlights in sequence ‚Üí verify highlights clear on stop

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T005 [P] [US1] Add highlightSentence() function in content.js that wraps text in <span> with highlight class
- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Add removeHighlight() function in content.js that unwraps span and restores original text
- [ ] T007 [US1] Add START_HIGHLIGHTING message handler in content.js that parses sentences and initializes timings
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add UPDATE_HIGHLIGHT_PROGRESS message handler in content.js that checks current time vs sentence timings
- [ ] T009 [US1] Add PLAYBACK_STOPPED message handler in content.js that calls cleanupHighlights()
- [ ] T010 [US1] Add PLAYBACK_PAUSED message handler in content.js that preserves current highlight
- [ ] T011 [US1] Add PLAYBACK_RESUMED message handler in content.js that continues highlighting
- [ ] T012 [US1] Modify background.js context menu handler to send START_HIGHLIGHTING message with text, audioDuration, playbackSpeed
- [ ] T013 [US1] Modify offscreen.js audio playback to send UPDATE_HIGHLIGHT_PROGRESS every 100ms during playback
- [ ] T014 [US1] Modify offscreen.js pause event to send PLAYBACK_PAUSED message
- [ ] T015 [US1] Modify offscreen.js resume/play event to send PLAYBACK_RESUMED message
- [ ] T016 [US1] Modify offscreen.js stop/ended event to send PLAYBACK_STOPPED message

**Manual Test Checklist for User Story 1**:
- [ ] Select text with 3+ sentences ‚Üí right-click "Read Aloud" ‚Üí first sentence highlights immediately
- [ ] Highlighting progresses sequentially through sentences as audio plays
- [ ] Previous highlight removed when moving to next sentence
- [ ] Pause playback ‚Üí current sentence stays highlighted
- [ ] Resume playback ‚Üí highlighting continues from current position
- [ ] Stop playback OR audio completes ‚Üí all highlights removed
- [ ] Console shows no errors during highlighting operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - basic sentence highlighting works

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Auto-scroll to Highlighted Text (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Automatically scroll page to keep currently highlighted sentence visible in viewport

**Independent Test**: Select long text passage (10+ sentences) ‚Üí scroll to top ‚Üí trigger playback ‚Üí verify page auto-scrolls to highlighted sentences

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Add scrollToHighlightIfNeeded() function in content.js using element.scrollIntoView()
- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Add isElementInViewport() helper function in content.js to check visibility
- [ ] T019 [US2] Modify highlightSentence() in content.js to call scrollToHighlightIfNeeded() after creating highlight
- [ ] T020 [US2] Configure scrollIntoView with behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' for optimal positioning

**Manual Test Checklist for User Story 2**:
- [ ] Select long passage (10+ sentences) spanning multiple screens
- [ ] Scroll to page top before triggering playback
- [ ] Verify page auto-scrolls smoothly to keep highlighted sentence centered in viewport
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary scrolling when sentence already visible
- [ ] Manually scroll during playback ‚Üí next sentence auto-scroll still works
- [ ] Auto-scroll is smooth (no jarring jumps) at behavior: 'smooth'

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should work together - highlighting with auto-scroll

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Playback Speed Integration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Adjust sentence highlighting timing dynamically when playback speed changes

**Independent Test**: Start playback ‚Üí change speed to 2x ‚Üí verify highlighting speeds up ‚Üí change to 0.5x ‚Üí verify highlighting slows down

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T021 [P] [US3] Add SPEED_CHANGED message handler in content.js
- [ ] T022 [US3] Implement timing recalculation logic in SPEED_CHANGED handler using calculateSentenceTimings()
- [ ] T023 [US3] Modify background.js speed change handler to send SPEED_CHANGED message to content script
- [ ] T024 [US3] Add currentTime parameter to SPEED_CHANGED message for accurate resync after recalculation

**Manual Test Checklist for User Story 3**:
- [ ] Start playback at 1x speed ‚Üí verify normal highlighting progression
- [ ] Change to 2x speed mid-playback ‚Üí verify highlighting speeds up (sentences change twice as fast)
- [ ] Change to 0.5x speed mid-playback ‚Üí verify highlighting slows down (sentences change half as fast)
- [ ] Rapid speed changes (1x ‚Üí 2x ‚Üí 0.5x) ‚Üí highlighting stays synchronized
- [ ] Speed change during pause ‚Üí resume ‚Üí highlighting uses new speed
- [ ] Console shows successful timing recalculation messages

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - complete highlighting feature

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and final validations

- [ ] T025 [P] Add error handling in content.js for DOM mutation scenarios (graceful degradation)
- [ ] T026 [P] Add defensive checks in highlightSentence() for invalid sentence indices
- [ ] T027 Add memory cleanup verification: test 20+ playback cycles and check Chrome Task Manager
- [ ] T028 Add performance optimization: implement sentence windowing for passages >100 sentences
- [ ] T029 Test edge cases: very short sentences (1-2 words), very long sentences (100+ words)
- [ ] T030 Test cross-website compatibility: news sites, documentation, blogs (3+ different sites)
- [ ] T031 Add console logging for debugging: highlight start/stop, sentence transitions, timing calculations
- [ ] T032 Verify cleanupHighlights() properly unwraps all spans and restores original DOM
- [ ] T033 Test with dynamic content: pages that modify DOM during playback
- [ ] T034 Run all manual test checklists from quickstart.md
- [ ] T035 Validate message contracts: verify all 6 message types send/receive correctly

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: N/A - No setup needed (extension already configured)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: No dependencies - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3) can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4) depends on US1 completion (needs highlightSentence() to exist)
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5) depends on US1 completion (needs timing system to exist)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs highlighting infrastructure) - Enhancement to US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs timing system) - Enhancement to US1

**Rationale**: US1 must be complete first as it provides the core highlighting infrastructure. US2 and US3 are enhancements that could potentially run in parallel after US1 is done, but US2‚ÜíUS3 sequential order is recommended for testing clarity.

### Within Each User Story

**Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T001-T002: Text utilities in parallel (different functions in same file)
- T003-T004: Content script setup in parallel with text utilities

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
- T005-T006: Highlight manipulation functions in parallel (different functions)
- T007-T011: Message handlers in parallel (different handlers)
- T012-T016: Background/offscreen modifications in parallel (different files)
- All tasks within US1 can execute in parallel as they touch different functions/files

**User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
- T017-T018: Helper functions in parallel
- T019-T020: Sequential (modify existing highlightSentence function)

**User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- T021-T022: Content script changes in parallel (different message handler)
- T023-T024: Background script changes in parallel (different file)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:
- T001 & T002: Both utility functions can be developed in parallel
- T003 & T004: Content script functions can be developed in parallel

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
- T005 & T006: Highlight functions in parallel
- T007-T011: All message handlers in parallel (different switch cases)
- T012-T016: Background and offscreen modifications in parallel (different files)

**User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
- T017 & T018: Helper functions in parallel

**User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- T021 & T022: SPEED_CHANGED handler in parallel with timing logic
- T023 & T024: Background modification in parallel with message structure

**Polish Phase (Phase 6)**:
- T025 & T026: Error handling tasks in parallel (different functions)
- T029-T034: All testing tasks can run in parallel (different test scenarios)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or different functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Manual testing after each phase checkpoint
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- No automated tests generated - spec does not request test implementation
- All testing is manual via Chrome browser (per constitution requirement)
