# Specification Quality Checklist: ElevenLabs API Integration for Text-to-Speech

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: The specification maintains a business and user-focused perspective. While it mentions ElevenLabs API by name (necessary for feature identity), it avoids implementation specifics like HTTP methods, code structures, or technical architectures. All sections describe WHAT users need and WHY, deferring HOW to the planning phase.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each FR can be verified through specific actions (e.g., "Extension MUST retrieve API key from storage" can be tested by checking storage access). Success criteria include specific metrics (5 seconds for audio, 95% success rate, 100ms pause response). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all design decisions made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions.

**Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific targets:
- Time-based: "within 5 seconds", "under 100ms", "within 2 seconds"
- Rate-based: "95% success rate", "95% without interruption", "100% error handling"
- Quality: "No console errors", "tested with 10+ consecutive requests"

Each criterion is technology-agnostic and focuses on user-facing outcomes rather than implementation details.

**Feature Readiness**: Three prioritized user stories (P1: API integration, P2: Playback controls, P3: Error handling) provide independent, testable slices. Each story has clear acceptance scenarios covering success paths and error conditions. Edge cases comprehensively cover API failures, network issues, browser restrictions, and resource management. Scope clearly delineates Phase 3 from future phases.

## Notes

- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All mandatory sections complete with concrete details
- No outstanding clarifications needed
- 10 assumptions documented with clear rationale
- 5 risks identified with mitigation strategies
- Dependencies clearly mapped to Phase 1, Phase 2, and external services
