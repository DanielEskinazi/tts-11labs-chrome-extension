# Feature Specification: Real-time Text Highlighting

**Feature Branch**: `007-text-highlighting`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add a feature where we could highlight the text in the page that we are reading so that we could follow along. Use sentence-by-sentence highlighting for a smooth reading experience."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Sentence Highlighting During Playback (Priority: P1)

A user selects text on a webpage and triggers "Read Aloud". As the audio plays, each sentence is highlighted with a visible background color as it's being read. The highlighting moves from sentence to sentence in sync with the audio playback, allowing the user to follow along visually.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to follow along with the audio. Without highlighting, the feature has no value.

**Independent Test**: Select text → trigger playback → verify each sentence highlights in sequence as audio plays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** text-to-speech playback is active, **When** a sentence is being read, **Then** that sentence is highlighted with a visible background color
2. **Given** a sentence has finished being read, **When** the next sentence begins, **Then** the previous highlight is removed and the new sentence is highlighted
3. **Given** multiple sentences are selected, **When** playback progresses, **Then** the highlighting moves sequentially through each sentence
4. **Given** the user has paused playback, **When** playback is paused, **Then** the current sentence remains highlighted
5. **Given** playback is stopped or completed, **When** audio ends, **Then** all highlighting is removed from the page

### User Story 2 - Auto-scroll to Highlighted Text (Priority: P2)

A user has selected a long passage of text that extends beyond the visible viewport. As the audio plays and highlighting moves through sentences, the page automatically scrolls to keep the currently highlighted sentence visible in the viewport.

**Why this priority**: This improves the experience for longer content, but the basic highlighting (P1) can function without it.

**Independent Test**: Select long text passage → trigger playback → verify page auto-scrolls to keep highlighted sentence visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the currently highlighted sentence is outside the viewport, **When** that sentence begins, **Then** the page scrolls to bring the sentence into view
2. **Given** auto-scroll is active, **When** the page scrolls, **Then** the scroll is smooth and doesn't cause jarring jumps
3. **Given** the user manually scrolls during playback, **When** auto-scroll is triggered, **Then** it respects user intent and scrolls smoothly
4. **Given** highlighted text is already visible, **When** highlighting moves to the next sentence, **Then** no unnecessary scrolling occurs

### User Story 3 - Playback Speed Integration (Priority: P2)

A user changes the playback speed while listening. The sentence highlighting timing automatically adjusts to match the new playback speed, ensuring highlights remain synchronized with the audio.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the feature but requires speed control integration. Basic highlighting can work at default speed.

**Independent Test**: Start playback → change speed → verify highlighting timing adjusts accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** playback speed is changed mid-sentence, **When** the new speed takes effect, **Then** sentence highlighting timing recalculates to match
2. **Given** playback is at 2x speed, **When** sentences are read, **Then** highlights progress twice as fast as at 1x speed
3. **Given** playback is at 0.5x speed, **When** sentences are read, **Then** highlights progress at half speed

### Edge Cases

- When text contains very short sentences (1-2 words), highlighting still works but may flash quickly
- When text contains very long sentences (100+ words), the entire sentence remains highlighted until completion
- When playback is paused and then resumed, highlighting continues from the current position
- When the user selects text that spans multiple DOM elements (e.g., across paragraphs), highlighting works across element boundaries
- When highlighting would obscure important UI elements, the page layout remains intact
- When the selected text has been modified or removed from the page, highlighting gracefully degrades

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST split selected text into sentences for sequential highlighting
- **FR-002**: System MUST highlight the current sentence being read with a visible background color
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove highlighting from the previous sentence when moving to the next
- **FR-004**: System MUST synchronize sentence highlighting timing with audio playback duration
- **FR-005**: System MUST clear all highlighting when playback stops or completes
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve highlighting state when playback is paused
- **FR-007**: System MUST auto-scroll the page to keep the highlighted sentence visible in the viewport
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle text that spans multiple DOM elements
- **FR-009**: System MUST adjust highlighting timing when playback speed changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST not break page layout or styling when applying highlights

### Key Entities

- **Sentence**: A unit of text delimited by sentence-ending punctuation (. ! ?)
- **Highlight**: A visual indicator (background color) applied to the currently active sentence
- **Timing Map**: A data structure mapping each sentence to its start/end time in the audio

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Sentence highlighting synchronizes with audio within 200ms accuracy
- **SC-002**: Highlighting transitions smoothly between sentences without visual glitches
- **SC-003**: Auto-scroll keeps highlighted text visible 100% of the time for long passages
- **SC-004**: Page layout remains intact with no broken styles or UI issues
- **SC-005**: Highlighting persists correctly across pause/resume cycles
- **SC-006**: All highlights are removed within 100ms of playback stopping

## Assumptions

- Text will be split into sentences using standard punctuation (. ! ?)
- Audio duration is known before playback starts
- Timing is estimated evenly across sentences (each sentence gets proportional time based on length)
- Highlight color will be visible on most webpage backgrounds (using semi-transparent yellow)
- The selected text remains in the DOM during playback (not dynamically removed)
- Auto-scroll will use smooth scrolling behavior supported by modern browsers

## Dependencies

- Existing text-to-speech playback system must provide audio duration
- Content script must have access to the original text selection and DOM range
- Playback control system must communicate playback events (play, pause, stop, speed change)
- Browser must support smooth scrolling and element highlighting

## Out of Scope

- Word-by-word highlighting (karaoke style)
- Custom highlight colors or styles (will use default yellow)
- Highlighting for non-text elements (images, videos, etc.)
- Sentence parsing for languages other than English
- User preferences for enabling/disabling highlighting
- Persistent highlight storage or replay functionality
