# Specification Quality Checklist: Voice Selection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and pass. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- No framework-specific details (uses generic terms like "extension popup", "local storage")
- Focused on user needs (voice selection, preview, preference persistence)
- Accessible to non-technical readers
- All mandatory sections present

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All requirements use testable language (MUST, specific actions)
- Success criteria are quantifiable (within 2 seconds, within 1 second, 100% persistence)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific tech)
- Each user story has multiple acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases cover API failures, voice availability, concurrent operations
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds feature limits
- Assumptions and Dependencies sections populated

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover complete user journey (view → select → preview → playback)
- Success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- No implementation leakage detected
