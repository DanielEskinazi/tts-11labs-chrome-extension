# Feature Specification: Voice Selection

**Feature Branch**: `006-voice-selection`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a feature for voice selection in the Chrome extension. Users should be able to choose from different ElevenLabs voices for text-to-speech playback. The voice selection should:
- Display available voices from the ElevenLabs API
- Allow users to preview voices before selecting
- Remember the user's voice preference across sessions
- Integrate with the existing audio playback system
- Be accessible from the extension popup UI
- Default to a reasonable voice if no preference is set

The feature should follow the same patterns as the playback speed control feature, using chrome.storage.local for persistence and integrating cleanly with the offscreen audio player."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: When the voice list API fails or the selected voice becomes unavailable, what should happen? → A: Auto-fallback to default voice and show non-blocking notification to user
- Q: How should the voice list be displayed in the popup UI? → A: Dropdown/select menu (compact, but requires click to see options)
- Q: Where should the voice preview functionality be placed with a dropdown menu? → A: Single preview button outside dropdown that previews the currently selected voice
- Q: When does the voice selection become committed and saved? → A: Immediately upon selecting from dropdown (auto-save)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Select Voice (Priority: P1)

A user wants to change the voice used for text-to-speech playback. They open the extension popup and see a dropdown menu for voice selection. When they click the dropdown, they see all available voices with clear labels (e.g., "Rachel - Female, American", "Josh - Male, American"). They select a voice from the dropdown, and the selection is automatically saved immediately (auto-save) and applied to all future playback.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to personalize their listening experience. Without the ability to select a voice, the feature has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the popup, selecting a voice from the list, and verifying that the selection is persisted when the popup is closed and reopened. Delivers immediate value by allowing voice customization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the extension popup is open, **When** the user views the voice selection section, **Then** they see a dropdown menu that displays the currently selected voice
2. **Given** the user clicks the dropdown menu, **When** the dropdown expands, **Then** they see all available voices with descriptive names (name, gender, accent)
3. **Given** the user selects a voice from the dropdown, **When** the selection is made, **Then** the voice preference is immediately saved (auto-save) and persisted across browser sessions
4. **Given** the user has previously selected a voice, **When** they open the popup, **Then** their selected voice is displayed in the dropdown as the current selection
5. **Given** no voice has been previously selected, **When** the user opens the popup for the first time, **Then** the default voice is displayed in the dropdown as the current selection

---

### User Story 2 - Preview Voice Before Selection (Priority: P2)

A user is unsure which voice they prefer. They want to hear a sample of each voice before making a selection. Next to the voice dropdown menu, they see a "Preview" button. They select a voice from the dropdown and click the preview button to hear a short sample phrase spoken in that voice, allowing them to make an informed decision before finalizing their selection.

**Why this priority**: This significantly improves the user experience by allowing informed decision-making, but the basic selection feature (P1) can function without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting different voices in the dropdown and clicking the preview button to verify that sample audio plays for each selected voice. Delivers value by helping users choose the voice they prefer without trial and error.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the voice selection interface is displayed, **When** the user selects a voice from the dropdown and clicks the preview button, **Then** a short sample phrase is played in that voice
2. **Given** a preview is currently playing, **When** the user selects a different voice and clicks preview again, **Then** the current preview stops and the new preview begins
3. **Given** a preview is playing, **When** the user clicks the preview button again, **Then** the preview stops
4. **Given** the user is previewing a voice, **When** the preview completes, **Then** the preview button returns to its initial state and is ready for another preview

### User Story 3 - Voice Selection Integrates with Playback (Priority: P1)

A user has selected their preferred voice. When they select text on a webpage and choose "Read Aloud" from the context menu, the text is read using their selected voice. If they change their voice preference later, all subsequent text-to-speech playback uses the new voice.

**Why this priority**: Integration with the existing playback system is essential for the feature to be functional. Without this, voice selection would have no effect on actual usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a voice, triggering text-to-speech playback, and verifying the correct voice is used. Delivers core value by applying user preferences to playback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has selected a specific voice, **When** they trigger text-to-speech playback, **Then** the audio is generated using their selected voice
2. **Given** the user changes their voice selection, **When** they trigger new text-to-speech playback, **Then** the new voice is used for playback
3. **Given** the user has selected a voice and closed the browser, **When** they reopen the browser and trigger playback, **Then** their previously selected voice is still used
4. **Given** the user's selected voice becomes unavailable, **When** they trigger text-to-speech playback, **Then** the system uses the default voice and displays a non-blocking notification informing the user

### Edge Cases

- When the voice list cannot be retrieved from the API (network error, API unavailable), the system falls back to using the cached voice list (if available within 24 hours) or displays an error notification while still allowing playback with the currently selected or default voice
- When the user's previously selected voice is no longer available in the API response, the system automatically switches to the default voice and shows a non-blocking notification informing the user of the change
- When preview audio fails to generate or play, the system displays an error message adjacent to the preview button without blocking voice selection or the ability to save the voice preference
- When the selected voice is not available during playback, the system automatically uses the default voice and shows a non-blocking notification to the user
- When multiple voice selections are attempted simultaneously, the most recent selection takes precedence and is saved

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve the list of available voices from the ElevenLabs API
- **FR-002**: System MUST display voice options in a dropdown/select menu in the extension popup with descriptive information (name, gender, accent)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select a voice from the displayed list
- **FR-004**: System MUST immediately persist the user's voice selection to local storage upon dropdown selection change (auto-save), ensuring preference is retained across browser sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply the selected voice to all text-to-speech playback operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a preview button adjacent to the voice dropdown that plays a sample phrase in the currently selected voice
- **FR-007**: System MUST use a default voice when no user preference has been set
- **FR-008**: System MUST gracefully handle cases where the selected voice becomes unavailable by automatically falling back to the default voice and displaying a non-blocking notification to inform the user
- **FR-009**: System MUST stop any currently playing preview when a new preview is started
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow only one preview to play at a time
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with the existing offscreen audio player architecture
- **FR-012**: System MUST cache the voice list to minimize API calls (cache expires after 24 hours)

### Key Entities

- **Voice**: Represents an available ElevenLabs voice with attributes including voice ID, name, descriptive labels (gender, accent), and preview sample capability
- **Voice Preference**: Stores the user's selected voice ID and is persisted across sessions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view and select from the complete list of available voices within 2 seconds of opening the popup
- **SC-002**: Voice previews play within 1 second of clicking the preview button
- **SC-003**: Selected voice preference persists across 100% of browser restarts without data loss
- **SC-004**: Voice selection applies to playback with 100% consistency (no cases where wrong voice is used)
- **SC-005**: System gracefully handles voice availability issues without blocking playback (falls back to default voice)
- **SC-006**: Users can successfully change voices and hear the difference in playback without needing to restart the extension

## Assumptions

- The ElevenLabs API provides a stable endpoint for retrieving the list of available voices
- Voice IDs returned by the API remain consistent over time (same voice = same ID)
- A default voice ID will be hardcoded for fallback scenarios (assuming "Rachel" or similar commonly available voice)
- The preview sample phrase can be a generic text like "Hello, this is a preview of this voice"
- Voice list updates are not real-time critical; a 24-hour cache is acceptable
- The extension already has valid API credentials configured for ElevenLabs API access
- The existing audio playback system accepts voice ID as a parameter

## Dependencies

- ElevenLabs API endpoint for retrieving voice list must be accessible and documented
- Existing offscreen audio player must support voice parameter configuration
- Extension popup UI framework must support dynamic list rendering and event handling

## Out of Scope

- Voice categorization or filtering by language, gender, or accent (initial version shows all voices in a simple list)
- Custom voice creation or upload
- Voice settings beyond selection (e.g., pitch adjustment, tone modification)
- Multi-voice support for different text sections
- Voice recommendation based on content type or user behavior
- Server-side storage of voice preferences (all storage is local to the browser)
